- 👋 Hi, I’m @adagiolab
- 👀 I’m interested in science, music, tech, all things related to beverages, and language translation between English and Mandarin. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a full-stack web app, and how to play the violin and drums. 
- 💞️ I’m open to exploring collaboration on anything that sounds interesting, but particularly in science communication. 
- 📫 The best way to reach me is through email at yunxi-@outlook.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a Shih Tzu named Dodo (after the musical note Do).
